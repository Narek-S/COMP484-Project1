                <h3>Early Timekeeping and the Mechanical Clock</h3>
                <p>
                    Historians trace the first mechanical clocks to around 1275 in England, including an early minute-repeater installed at Salisbury Cathedral. 
                    Italy soon followed with astronomical clocks and chiming systems to mark hours and days. 
                    Blacksmiths forged these early mechanisms by hand, including large bells that could be heard throughout towns, long before the invention of dials and hands.
                    By 1462, personal timekeeping entered the conversation with the appearance of the “pocket clock,” the earliest reference to what we now call pocket watches.

                <h3>The Rise of Swiss Watchmaking</h3>

                    </figure>

                    The Swiss watchmaking tradition began in the mid-1500s as jewelers shifted professions due to religious bans on decorative jewelry.
                    With innovations in materials like brass, bronze, and silver, Swiss craftsmen helped establish the early foundations of horology.
                    The pocket watch became a staple of aristocratic fashion, especially after <span translate="no">Charles II</span> <!--Prevents browser auto-translation.--> popularized waistcoats, which provided a perfect place to stow them securely.
                    These early timepieces lacked glass protection. Instead, hinged cases and skeletonized covers protected delicate hands until glass became widespread in the 1600s.
                    Though rare, wrist-worn watches began to appear in the 19th century, particularly as jewelry for women.

                        While wristwatches date back centuries, the <b>first known design</b> is credited to <b>Abraham-Louis Breguet</b> , who crafted a <i>bracelet-style</i> timepiece in 1810 for the Queen of Naples.
                        In 1868, Patek Philippe followed suit with a bracelet watch for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary.
                        These were bespoke pieces, seen more as jewelry than tools.

                <h3>Mass Production and Wartime Innovation</h3>

                <p>
                    The 19th century ushered in mass production.
                    Companies like Waltham Watch Co. in the U.S. used assembly-line methods to produce watches affordably and reliably, expanding access to timekeeping beyond the elite.
                    This set the stage for wristwatches to become more practical — and more popular.

                <h3>The Wristwatch in Military Service</h3>
                <p>
                    By the early 1900s, wristwatches gained traction among aviators and officers.
                    Girard-Perregaux supplied German naval officers with wristwatches in the 1880s, and <b>Louis Cartier </b>designed the &quot;Santos&quot; <!--put "" for visual--> in 1904 for pilot <i>Alberto Santos-Dumont</i>.
                    During World War I, soldiers realized the value of wristwatches for <strong>synchronization and visibility in combat</strong> <!--strong emphesize for text reader-->.
                    Trench watches, adapted from pocket movements,  became essential tools.
                    Watchmakers promoted their models heavily, and by war’s end, public demand for wristwatches had soared.

                <h3>The Evolution of Modern Watches</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the war, horological innovation accelerated.
                    The first automatic movement emerged in 1923. By the 1930s, Jaeger-LeCoultre had released &quot;the Reverso&quot;, designed for polo players who needed a way to protect their crystals during matches.
                    Brands like Rolex, Breitling, and Omega drove <b>innovation in waterproofing, chronographs, and design</b>.
                    The 1970s quartz revolution introduced electronic movements, eventually giving rise to today’s smartwatch industry.
